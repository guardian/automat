## Automat

Automat is a service developed by The Guardian to provide rich targeting and
personalisation capabilities for our core platforms.

## Notes

Automat is in early stages of development. This README file will be updated soon.

This project will be archived. It was an experiment to explore targeted messaging on the site, it is not under development anymore and there are no instances running in production.
